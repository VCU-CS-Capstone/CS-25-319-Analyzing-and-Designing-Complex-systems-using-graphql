## 1) Accomplishments this week ##
   - Got a new Hasura DDN with mock user data 
   - we have progressed with data governance as far as possible without Hasura-based data.	
   - Got group information sent between auth0 and hasura (group user is still available since not hosted on csmc 508 server)

## 2) Milestones to be completed next week ##
   - Need to update new Hasura DDN with larger mock data to be able to visualize
   - Get new data hosted on new hasura DDN
   - Get SQL queries to create tables
   - Get auth0 updated with new hasura information

## 3) Issues, problems or concerns ##
   - unavailability of the old Hasura Cloud instance due to the CMSC 508 server being taken down, which hosted our data.
